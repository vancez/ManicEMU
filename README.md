Manic EMU is an all-in-one retro game emulator for iOS. It brings console,
arcade, computer, and mobile Java systems into one app while keeping a clean,
sleek UI and smooth gameplay-focused controls.

The sections below keep the app details up front, then connect availability,
features, development notes, related documentation, repository layout, and
licensing in one place.

> Manic EMU does not include ROMs, ISOs, BIOS files, or copyrighted game data.
> Use legally owned backups, homebrew, and public-domain software only. See
> the upstream [anti-piracy policy](https://github.com/Manic-EMU/ManicEMU/blob/main/ANTI_PIRACY.md)

## At a Glance

- App distribution: App Store, AltStore, StikStore, and SideStore.
- Source target: iOS app built with Xcode 16+, iOS SDK 15+, and Swift 5.9+.
- Emulator model: multiple emulator cores, including Libretro-based frameworks
  and dedicated cores.
- User experience: game library, custom skins, saves, cheats, filters,
  screenshots, landscape mode, and custom shortcuts.
- Sync and import: iCloud sync plus Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, Baidu
  Cloud, Aliyun, WebDAV, and SMB import paths.
- Online and big-screen play: RetroAchievements, select online-capable cores,
  AirPlay mirroring, and controller support.
- Project stance: open source, community-driven, and anti-piracy.

## Availability

Manic EMU is available through Apple's App Store and through sideloading
channels including AltStore, StikStore, and SideStore.

<p align="center">

    <img src="docs/assets/branding/appstore-badge.png" alt="Download on the App Store" width="170">
  </a>
  <a href="https://stikstore.app">
    <img src="docs/assets/branding/stikstore-badge.png" alt="Available on StikStore" width="170">

  <a href="https://sidestore.io">
    <img src="docs/assets/branding/sidestore-badge.png" alt="Available on SideStore" width="170">
  </a>
</p>

Compatibility and performance vary by device, iOS version, emulator core, game,
and JIT availability. App Store builds and sideloaded builds may differ where
Apple services, signing, or JIT workflows are involved.

### AltStore Source

Add Manic EMU as an AltStore source, then install it from there:

```
https://github.com/vancez/ManicEMU/releases/latest/download/altstore.json
```

Each release publishes an unsigned sideload build together with its own
`altstore.json`, so the `/latest/` address above always serves the newest
version. AltStore, SideStore, or StikStore re-signs the IPA with your own
certificate during install, so a free Apple ID is enough. iCloud sync and App
Group features are unavailable in sideloaded builds.

## Development Notes

### Runtime

- iPhone or iPad hardware capable of running the selected emulator core.
- Legally obtained game backups and any required system files.
- Optional RetroAchievements account for achievement tracking.
- Optional cloud provider accounts for cloud import and sync workflows.

### Build

- macOS with Xcode 26 or newer.
- iOS SDK 15 or newer.
- Swift 5.9 or newer.
- Git LFS for binary cores and bundled system assets.
- Apple Developer Program account for services such as App Groups,
  In-App Purchases, and iCloud. These capabilities must be configured by the
  builder or removed before compiling.
- Third-party API keys for services configured through `Cipher.swift`, when
  those services are enabled.

### Build Steps

1. Install Git LFS:

   ```sh
   brew install git-lfs
   git lfs install
   ```

2. Clone the upstream Manic EMU repository:

   ```sh
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/Manic-EMU/ManicEMU.git
   ```

3. Open the Xcode project:

   ```sh
   open ManicEMU/ManicEmu/ManicEmu.xcodeproj
   ```

4. Update the developer team and bundle identifier in the ManicEmu target's
   Signing & Capabilities settings.
5. Wait for Swift Package Manager to finish resolving packages, then run the
   app with `Cmd+R`.

Some cores are integrated as binary frameworks, while most cores are built from
upstream source code without modifications. Upstream core changes are tracked
through the [Daiuno repositories](https://github.com/Daiuno?tab=repositories).

### Release Builds

`.github/workflows/release.yml` builds the sideload IPA on GitHub Actions and
publishes it, together with a generated `altstore.json`, to a GitHub Release.

The workflow runs on `v*` tags and on manual dispatch. Before building, it fails
if the tag does not match `APP_VERSION` in
`ManicEmu/ManicEmu/Resources/Config-Base.xcconfig`, so bump `APP_VERSION` and
`APP_BUILD_VERSION` there first, then tag:

```sh
git tag v2.0.1 && git push origin v2.0.1
```

The build uses the `ManicEmuSideload` scheme and the `SideloadRelease`
configuration, with code signing disabled. The resulting IPA is unsigned and is
re-signed on device by AltStore, SideStore, or StikStore.
